### Car Price Prediction Model

This project was meant to be a way to practice using Streamlit to deploy models out into the real world. I focused less on finding the perfect dataset and building the perfect model and more on actually deploying a model with a frontend that can speak to my model and make live predictions.

I'm using this dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/car-price-prediction-challenge) and here's the actual site I built: (https://drakeweissman-carmodel-car-model-app-o5nzwd.streamlit.app/)
